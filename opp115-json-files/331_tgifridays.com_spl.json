With this information we make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our website, mobile application, any related services, and enjoy your guest experience at our restaurants (in the case of voluntary surveys). Our ability to provide enhanced services may occasionally depend on our ability to develop summary reports for our advertising agents that contain raw numbers or statistics (but never tell them who it was that stated a preference or clicked an option). It is our policy to never send messages to website users unless they request that we do so.": {
